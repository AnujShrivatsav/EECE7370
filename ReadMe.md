This project was done as a part of the Advanced Computer Vision course where we analyse the performance of Diffusion models in the domain of 3D Shape completion from noisy or partial point clouds.

## TODO

- [x] Task 1: Clone DiffComplete repo as a submodule
- [x] Task 2: Download neccessary datasets
- [x] Task 3: Reproduce results from the DiffComplete paper to setup as baseline
- [x] Task 4: Download datasets with 3D and images correspondence to train the CLIP model
- [x] Task 5: Make changes to the DiffComplete architecture to condition on CLIP embeddings
- [ ] Task 6: Train the conditional Diffusion model and compare against baseline
