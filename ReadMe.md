This project was done as a part of the Advanced Computer Vision course where we analyse the performance of Diffusion models in the domain of 3D Shape completion from noisy or partial point clouds.

## TODO

- [x] Task 1: Clone DiffComplete repo as a submodule
- Task 2: Download neccessary datasets
- Task 3: Reproduce results from the DiffComplete paper to setup as baseline
- Task 4: Clone CLIP repo as a submodule
- Task 5: Download datasets with 3D and images correspondence to train the CLIP model
- Task 6: Make changes to the DiffComplete architecture to condition on the trained CLIP features
- Task 7: Train the conditional Diffusion model and compare against baseline
